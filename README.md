This project is a showcase of AWS rekognition and S3 bucket connected to a react front-end.

There is some extra work with Google Cloud Natural Language Api, the reponse data has not been structured well but the api call works perfectly.

Api calls will not work as services have been suspended (aws incurring costs are too hefty)

Mission 2 in the Advance Software Developer course from Mission Ready. 

-- To start the project run - npm install && npm start --
