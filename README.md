This project is a showcase of AWS rekognition and S3 bucket connected to a react front-end.

There is some extra work with Google Cloud Natural Language Api but it is not fully functional, it is giving a 403 response error due not validating correctly because of not having necessary permissions.
Api calls will not work as services have been suspended (aws incurring costs are too hefty)

Mission 2 in the Advance Software Developer course from Mission Ready. 

-- To start the project run - npm install && npm start --
